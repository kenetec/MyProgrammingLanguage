# MyProgrammingLanguage

This is a project I started a long time ago in high school when I wanted to make my own programming language. It serves now as a playground for me to learn about interpreter/compiler design.

## Resources I used to create this
* [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)
  * Fanastic series that provides a digestible way to understand interpreters.
